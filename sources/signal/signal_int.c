/*
The following functon is a very simple yer effective signal handler.
It receives the signal identificator, which we name Signum (signal number)

If the signal is suposed to kill the program execution, it will print a new line
and do nothing else. If the program receives any other signal, it shall keep the
program going, but making a few changes in it's operation.

Below is a list of the changes made. In the right there are their former uses, and in the left, their actual uses.

ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.		<- ctrl-C ends the program. 
ctrl-D exits the shell.							<- ctrl-D sends EOF to the terminal
ctrl-\ does nothing.							<- ctrl-\ sends a SIGQUIT command to the program

The case of ctrl-D is the trickiest to solve, since it is not a standard signal.
It simply returns EOF, which is 'sensed' by readline, therefore it's call for action
is in the loop function.
